## About

So that learning and movement are no longer at odds with each other, the Campus MOBIL project has set itself the goal of bringing more movement and health into students' everyday lives.

Students are not only exposed to enormous stress during exam time, but are also repeatedly confronted with challenges in their everyday student life. A lack of rest and exercise breaks between lectures often leads to students reaching a state of physical and mental overload. Also due to time pressure, the renunciation of sports as well as the resort to a fast but often unbalanced diet is pre-programmed, since there is simply no energy left to deal with one's health. Health, which is probably our most important asset, deserves exactly that.

The URfit app is a web-based application in which students can find offers for a healthier daily study routine in the form of exercise, fitness and relaxation videos and audio files. A link to Mensa offerings is also included.
